**Privacy Policy for MultiClock**

**Effective Date:** 12/26/2024

**Introduction**

Welcome to MultiClock, a calculator app that helps you determine your 8.5-hour workday
clock-out time and provides weather information. This Privacy Policy explains
how Vector Flow Dynamics ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our
mobile application (MultiClock).

**Information We Collect**

We **do not collect any personal information** from you when you use MultiClock. Specifically:

* **No User Input Data Storage:** The start time and break duration you enter for calculations are
  processed locally on your device and are **not stored** on our servers or anywhere else.
* **No Location Data Access:** Our app does **not request or access your device's location**.
* **No Device Information:** We do **not** collect any device information such as device model,
  operating system, or unique device identifiers.
* **No Usage Data:** We do **not** collect any data about how you use the app.

**How We Use Information**

Since we do not collect any information, we do not use it for any purpose. All calculations are
performed locally on your device.

**Weather Data**

* Our app allows you to manually enter a location to retrieve weather information.
* We use a third-party weather
  API (OpenWeatherMap API) to display weather
  information. When you manually enter a location, that location is sent to the weather API to
  retrieve relevant weather data.
* The weather API provider may collect your IP address in order to respond to the request. Please
  refer to the weather API provider's privacy policy for more details on their data collection
  practices. (https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy#:~:text=We%20may%20collect%2C%20use%2C%20store,API%20products%20they%20were%20made.)

**Sharing Your Information**

We do **not** share any information with third parties, except for the location you manually enter
to query the weather API provider as described above.

**Data Retention**

We do **not** retain any user data.

**Your Choices**

* **Weather Data:** You are not required to use the weather feature. You can choose not to enter any
  location, and no data will be shared with the weather API.

**Security**

Since we do not collect or store any user data, security risks are minimized.

**Children's Privacy**

Our app does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by
posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or through other appropriate means. You are advised to
review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
